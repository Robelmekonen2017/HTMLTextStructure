         <h2>The Orgins of The Rap Genre</h2>
         <p>The influcencal genre of music known as rap started somwhere to.<br>
         <p>Rap is actually a very old word. You can find the term popping up as early as the 15th and 16th century in Britain.
         Initially the word rap meant to strike or to hit. A few centuries later a slight variation of this definition appeared which meant to speak or talk. 
         In America around the 1960’s it began to pop up in the black community and was used as a slang word to mean that someone was talking or having a conversation.
         Thousands of years ago in Africa “griots”, where village story tellers who played basic handmade instruments while they told stories of their family and local current events. 
         This style of talking while music is playing is rap music as we know it at its root form.</p>
         <h2>Momentum</h2>
		 <p>Rap first started to hit the Hip-Hop scene during the 70's.Old school rap (1979–84) was "easily identified by its relatively simple raps".According to AllMusic, "the emphasis was not on lyrical technique, but simply on good times", one notable exception being Melle Mel, who set the way for future rappers through his socio-political content and creative wordplay.Old school flows were relatively basic and used only few syllables per bar, simple rhythmic patterns, and basic rhyming techniques and rhyme schemes.Melle Mel is cited as an MC who epitomizes the old school flow – Kool Moe Dee says, "from 1970 to 1978 we rhymed one way then Melle Mel, in 1978, gave us the new cadence we would use from 1978 to 1986". He's the first emcee to explode in a new rhyme cadence, and change the way every emcee rhymed forever. Rakim, The Notorious B.I.G., and Eminem have flipped the flow, but Melle Mel's downbeat on the two, four, kick to snare cadence is still the rhyme foundation all emcees are building on".</p>
